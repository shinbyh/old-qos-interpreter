Versatile Network Architecture: QoS Interpreter for Applications

## Versatile Networking Architecture for Edge Networks
It is a novel network architecture which aims to match appropriate computing/networking/content resources and user requirements. Our vision is to make the underlying "edge network" become smarter so that it can understand user/application requirements and automatically (re)configure the network parameters such as network interfaces, routing paths, location of contents, etc.
The Versatile Networking Architecture has mainly three parts: (1) User/applicaion requirement interpretation, (2) Underlying resource pooling, and (3) matching user/application requirements and resources.

## QoS Interpreter
This project targets to implement the first part of the Versatile Networking Architecture: User/application requirement interpretation. The goal of this project consists of:
* An API for accepting Application Profiles which is a special markup description language for describing service requirements
* An interpreter for converting the Application Profile into QoS requirements which is compatible with resource pooling and matching modules.
